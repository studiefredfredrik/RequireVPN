There are some applications that you do not want to use while on a non-trusted network.
And usually if your VPN connection goes down the OS will try to use your normal, un-secure
connection.

RequireVPN is a program you can set to monitor a given network adapter (your VPN connection),
and set it to kill a given process if the network adapter disconnects.
